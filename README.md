Python script used to crawl websites to find security vulnerabilities.
Enter a website address (include http://) to initiate the scan.
Scan will automatically find links on the website entered and will continue reviewing linked pages and websites for vulnerabilities. This will continue until you manually end the program (ctrl+C) 
This program was designed by me and I utilized chatGPT to help code some of the more advanced features I wanted to add with full explanations so that I could understand how it functions and how to replicate the code again in the future.
